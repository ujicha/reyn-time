An Advanced Combat Tracker (ACT) plugin for FFXIV that plays sounds for various events.

This plugin currently uses two directories (one for sounds, one for music). A random sound from the sound directory is played when an allied ninja uses Suiton and a random sound from the music directory is played when an allied ninja applies Vulnerability to an enemy.

More to come in the future focused on Frontlines.
